				</header>
				<p>
					Our service combines decades of tried and tested spot treating methods combined with our <strong>Innovative, Toxin-Free, Environmentally Safe and Healthy</strong> technologies. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Most dry cleaners use chemicals such as perchlorethylene or siloxane to dry clean your clothes.
					Effective as they may be in cleaning clothes, they also contain toxins that can be harmful to your body and the environment. 
					Our proven track record of customer satisfaction and best practices combined with our strict guidelines and internal methods provide an ensurance that each and every garment returns to you as if they were brand new.
					Along with our excellent dry cleaning service, we also offer additional options such as press only. Press only is a lower cost option to be used with new clothes or already cleaned clothes that require that professional crisp tailored look.

				</header>
				<p>
					Area and Oriental rugs are a beautiful addition to any home. 
					Like well-placed wall decor or fine paintings, they contribute to the overall character and complete the furnishing of a well-decorated room. 
					Unlike wall decor, however, area rugs usually receive a fair amount of traffic. 
					Rugs like this are often put down in high-traffic areas to decorate, liven up and even protect these living spaces. 
					But who is going to protect the rugs? 
					Similar to carpets and upholstered furniture, area rugs act as air filters for the home, trapping dirt, allergens and bacteria and preventing those unhealthy elements from circulating to other rooms. 
					But area rugs are only able to do this properly if they are maintained and kept clean. Just as an air filter for your home ventilation system needs to be regularly replaced, your carpets, upholstery, and area rugs need to be regularly cleaned. 
					We provide high quality area rug cleaning services, focusing on care and attention to detail, that restore the rugs to their original beauty while removing dirt and allergens.
