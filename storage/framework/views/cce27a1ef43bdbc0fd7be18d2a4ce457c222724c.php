				</header>
				<p>
					Our service combines decades of tried and tested spot treating methods combined with our <strong>Innovative, Toxin-Free, Environmentally Safe and Healthy</strong> cleaning technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most dry cleaners use chemicals such as perchloroethylene (perc) or siloxane to dry clean your clothes which contain toxins that can be harmful to your body and the environment.
					Our dry cleaning utilizes SystemK4 which a perc-free/halogen-free, organic solvent that has been tested to be dermatologically safe, biodegradable and provides an excellent, odorless finish to every garment.  
					Our proven track record of customer satisfaction and best practices ensures that each and every garment is handled with the utmost care.

				</header>
				<p>
					Area and Oriental rugs are a beautiful addition to any home. 
					Like well-placed wall decor or fine paintings, they contribute to the overall character and complete the furnishing of a well-decorated room. 
					Unlike wall decor, however, area rugs usually receive a fair amount of traffic. 
					Rugs like this are often put down in high-traffic areas to decorate, liven up and even protect these living spaces. 
					But who is going to protect the rugs? 
					Similar to carpets and upholstered furniture, area rugs act as air filters for the home, trapping dirt, allergens and bacteria and preventing those unhealthy elements from circulating to other rooms. 
					But area rugs are only able to do this properly if they are maintained and kept clean. Just as an air filter for your home ventilation system needs to be regularly replaced, your carpets, upholstery, and area rugs need to be regularly cleaned. 
					We provide high quality area rug cleaning services, focusing on care and attention to detail, that restore the rugs to their original beauty while removing dirt and allergens.
